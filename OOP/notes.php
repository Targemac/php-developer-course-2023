/**
 * --- OOP Principles ---
 * 1. Encapsulation describes the process of restricting data and methods to a single object or class
 * 2. Abstraction : is the idea of hiding complex detail and behaviour from the users
 * 3. inheritance: 
 *  - concret classes : has its implementation
 *  - abstract classes : doesnt have implementation
 * 4. polymorphism: referes to an object that can be represented in different ways
 * 
 * diff between astract and interface
 * 
 * ***abstarct classes***
 * -methods may have implementation
 * -properties allowed
 * -public, private, protected are allowed
 * -only one class can be extended
 * 
 * ***interfaces***
 * -methods may not have implementations
 * -properties not allowed, constants allowed
 * -only public methods allowed
 * -multiple interfaces an be implemented
